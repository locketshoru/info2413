<!-- File Purpose: view order page. -->

<%- include ('partials/header') %>

This is where you can view a specific order. Customers can only view their own orders, admins/employees can view all orders. From here, customers can cancel an order if the status says they can (otherwise the button is disabled), and admins/employees can edit the order. Post requests go out here.
