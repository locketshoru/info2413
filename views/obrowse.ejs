<!-- File Purpose: browse orders page. -->

<%- include ('partials/header') %>

This is where admins/employees only can browse open orders. Closed orders are not viewable in this way. Employees can claim an order by making a change to it before anyone else does, that assigns it to them. Admins can just change stuff. This POSTs to the cart page as well.
