<!-- File Purpose: Account summary and details. -->

<%- include ('partials/header') %>

This is the account page. All will be capable of viewing and changing their details - email, password, username, and avatar. Customers can also view their order history here, but can't actually do anything about it. Employees can see their order history here as well by the orders they've handled. Admins can do the same, you get the idea, and can also generate reports here, sent to the email on file.
Slingsby will code this in later and then someone else can add in the Mongo tags he needs to be using. 

<%- include ('partials/footer') %>
